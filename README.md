# STAFFING PORTAL

In this project, we aim to create a faculty recruitment portal for IIIT Lucknow, equipped with essential details and terms. Ensuring a seamless experience for all visitors to the portal is our priority.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

What sets our faculty recruitment portal apart is the inclusion of a dedicated format for each position. Whenever there is an opening, our website will feature a new section with written test and interview detailsâ€”an innovation not adopted by any other college to date. Additionally, we have introduced an effortlessly navigable interface for user convenience.
